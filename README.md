# Wireframe Exercise

## Have a design concept and a plan completely ready to go before you write the first line of code.

Built/Reviewed a wireframe showing all document dimensions Knew where images will go and how big they will be Used placeholder images during the setup process Knew where text would go and used placeholder lorem ipsum text Set up the project repository, scaffolded the files, and made sure they were wired together. Built out all of the HTML without applying any classes or IDs Worked top to bottom in the document, put elements into place with CSS, using the structure of the HTML to create selectors wherever it was possible. Sought to limit use of classes and IDs to only where they were needed. Applied color, backgrounds, borders, text styling, etc., to the specifications of the design.
